Course Description:                                                                                                           

The course introduces foundemental concepts and elements of operating systems. The content includes the basic operating system topics such as process management (e.g., process, threads, synchronization, CPU scheduling, deadlocks), memory management (e.g., main/virtual memory) and storage management (e.g., file systems, I/O systems). There are also a few advanced topics, such as security and protection, virtual machines, distributed systems and cloud computing. The programming environments focus on Linux, but also refer to various versions of UNIX (e.g., Mac OS) and Windows. The programming languages focus on C/C++.

 

Pre-requisites:                                                                                                                     

CS2013 is required, CS3035 is highly recommended. In addition, students should be familiar with C/C++ programming language and Linux system

 

Course goals:
