# Changelog: 02_2025-08-25 - C in Production 2025 Summary (Task 002)

**Task:** [002] Create Markdown summary in `week_1/` about where C is used in production (2025) with authoritative sources  
**Status:** Done

### Files Updated:
- **CREATED:** `week_1/C_in_production_2025.md` – concise, link-first summary of mainstream production uses of C across OS/kernel, networking, crypto, databases, media, AI runtimes, and tooling.

### Description:
Created a new Markdown document summarizing where C is actively used in production in 2025, focusing on authoritative, official documentation links for each domain (Linux kernel, eBPF, systemd, NGINX/HAProxy, WireGuard, libcurl, OpenSSL, zlib, SQLite/PostgreSQL, Redis, FFmpeg/GStreamer, libjpeg‑turbo/libpng, ONNX Runtime, cuDNN, OpenBLAS, Git, CPython, libuv).

### Reasoning:
Provide a grounded reference for learners to connect foundational C concepts to real-world, production‑grade projects and libraries. Emphasizes credible sources and minimal narrative to keep the document easy to scan and maintain.

### Key Decisions & Trade‑off:
- Prioritized link‑first curation over deep narrative for clarity and maintainability.
- Selected broadly accepted, mainstream projects to avoid overwhelm; omitted niche or overlapping entries.
- Kept scope focused on where C is primary or critical in the stack.

### Notes:
- Intended to complement `week_1/README.md` and `week_1/COMPARE_C_CPP_CUDA_RUST.md`.
- Future work could add tiny code samples showing how to call C libraries from C++ with modern build tooling.
